= DPoP Demos

This is a demo showing some proof-of-concepts with readily available DPoP implementations.

DPoP is an acronym for "`OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession`" and it is defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449[RFC9449].

This repository accompanies the FOSDEM 2025 talk https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5370-using-dpop-to-use-access-tokens-securely-in-your-single-page-applications/[Using DPoP to use access tokens securely in your Single Page Applications].
